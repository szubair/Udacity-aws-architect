Total Monthly bill: 3,466.85 USD

Summary:
---------

I have selected one-year reserve instances on ec2-instance service for the same instance type. It reduced the montly cost drascitally. I have taken similar approach on the RDS service too and able to reduce around 40% - 50% on the total monthly cost. I understand choosing ec2 instance savings plan itself is a great cost saviour in the AWS monthly bill. 

In the S3 storage service, EBS snapshots, DB snapshots and other application related files will keep increasing that leads to increase in the storage cost. I understand introducing lifecycle policies i.e move files which are not accessing for one month into S3 Glacier (archive) and then delete them after certain period will help me in maintaining the storage size in the S3 buckets. This will help to reduce the storage size and eventually reduce the montly bill. Moving into s3 glacier which is less priced than standard S3 will also reduce the cost. Therefore using other storage types like S3 Glacier, S3 infrequent access and implementing lifecyle policies will reduce the AWS monthly cost.

Using Lambda functions where we can substitude EC2 instances is good option to reduce the cost. The EC2 instances will be running 24/7 where lambda functions as api request are called whenever it is required. Therefore, lambda functions are also great cost savior.
