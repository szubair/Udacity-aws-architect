Summary:
Total: 3,500.96 USD

I have selected one-year reserve instances on ec2-instance service for the same instance type. It reduced the montly cost drascitally. I have taken similar approach on the RDS service too and able to reduce around 40% - 50% on the total monthly cost. I understand choosing ec2 instance savings plan itself is a great cost saviour in the AWS monthly bill. 

In the S3 storage service, EBS and DB snapshots and other application related files will keep increasing the storage cost. I understand introducing lifecycle policies i.e move files which are not accessing for one month into S3 Glacier (archive) and then delete them after certain period will help me in maintaining the storage size in the S3 buckets. And this will also reduce the montly bill by deleting and moving into s3 glacier which will less costly. Therefore, using storage type like S3 Glacier, S3 infrequent access type and implementing lifecyle policies will reduce the AWS monthly cost.
